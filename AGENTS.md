Here is what i want to do, I want to build a tool to make an audio book out of a pdf book provided

steps:

- Extract text from the PDF in very systematic way
- Split the text into chapters or sections
- Convert the text to speech using a TTS engine
- Save the audio files in a structured format
- Allow users to navigate through chapters or sections ( follow the index of the book and map it to the timestamps of the audio files, will be saved in the metadata of the audio files or a json file in the output folder)
